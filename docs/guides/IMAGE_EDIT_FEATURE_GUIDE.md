## Configuration

### OpenAI Settings (Locked)

```typescript
model: 'gpt-image-1.5'
size: '1024x1536' // Portrait
quality: 'low'
```

### Quota Settings

```typescript
default_quota_limit: 3 // Per book
```

### Rate Limiting

- OpenAI Tier 1: 5 images/90 seconds
- Handle rate limit errors gracefully

---

## Cost Considerations

**Per Edit Cost:** ~$0.02-0.04 (gpt-image-1.5, 1024x1536, low quality)

**Monthly Cost Estimates:**
- 100 edits: $2-4
- 1,000 edits: $20-40
- 10,000 edits: $200-400

**Storage:**
- Each edit: ~2-4MB (edited image + mask)
- 100 edits: ~200-400MB
- 1,000 edits: ~2-4GB

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **PIN Protection** (Optional)
   - Require PIN to access Book Settings
   - Store PIN in user metadata

2. **Batch Editing**
   - Edit multiple pages at once
   - Apply same fix to all pages

3. **AI-Powered Auto-Fix**
   - Detect common errors automatically
   - Suggest prompts

4. **Advanced Masking Tools**
   - Magic wand selection
   - Lasso tool
   - Rectangular selection

5. **Edit Templates**
   - Save frequently used masks
   - Quick apply saved prompts

6. **Analytics**
   - Track most common edits
   - Improve generation prompts based on feedback

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Edit quota exceeded"
**Solution:** User has used all 3 edits for this book. Consider upgrading quota or creating a new book.

### Issue: Canvas drawing not working
**Solution:** Check react-sketch-canvas is installed: `npm install react-sketch-canvas`

### Issue: Mask not exporting
**Solution:** Ensure canvas ref is properly set and canvas has been drawn on.

### Issue: OpenAI API error
**Solution:** Check API key, rate limits, and request format. See OpenAI docs for details.

### Issue: Image not updating after edit
**Solution:** Check that story_data.pages[].imageUrl is being updated and book state is refreshed.

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Fixes Applied (17 Ocak 2026)

1. **Mask Logic Inversion:**
   - **Problem:** Mask was inverted - painted areas were made opaque (preserved) instead of transparent (edit zone)
   - **Solution:** Inverted mask logic - painted areas → transparent (alpha=0) = edit zone, unpainted → opaque white (alpha=255) = preserve
   - **Result:** Only selected areas are edited, rest of image preserved correctly

2. **OpenAI API Compliance:**
   - Removed invalid parameters (`n`, `response_format`)
   - Response format: `b64_json` only (default for Image Edit API)
   - Added `input_fidelity: high` for better original image preservation
   - Added prompt prefix: "Only modify the masked area. Keep the rest of the image unchanged."

3. **Logging Optimization:**
   - Removed base64 dumps from logs (unreadable)
   - Added summary logging (data count, size, quality, usage tokens)

4. **UI Improvements:**
   - Brush color changed to red (more visible edit zone indicator)
   - Updated labels and descriptions for clarity
   - Eraser mode properly implemented (true erase, not black paint)
