## Prompt (v0.app'e yapıştırılacak)

```
Create an improved mobile navigation menu component for KidStoryBook that is more visually appealing and child-friendly.

Current Issues:
- The mobile menu design is not attractive
- Needs better visual hierarchy
- Should be more engaging for parents

Requirements:

**Design:**
- Slide-in menu from right side (using shadcn/ui Sheet component)
- Beautiful backdrop blur effect (semi-transparent overlay)
- Menu panel should have rounded corners on the left side
- Soft gradient background (light purple to pink, subtle)
- Better spacing and typography
- Icon-based navigation (optional icons next to links)

**Structure:**
- Header section: Logo + Close button (X icon)
- Navigation links section: Home, Examples, Pricing, About
  - Each link should have hover effect
  - Icons optional but recommended (Home icon, Book icon, Price tag icon, Info icon)
- Divider line
- Actions section at bottom:
  - Country/Currency selector (dropdown)
  - Shopping cart icon with badge
  - "Create a children's book" CTA button (full width, gradient)

**Animations (Framer Motion):**
- Slide in from right with smooth animation (0.3s)
- Stagger animation for navigation links (each appears with slight delay)
- Backdrop fade in/out
- Close button with scale animation on tap

**Styling:**
- Background: white with subtle gradient (light purple tint)
- Text: dark gray for readability
- Icons: purple/pink accent color
- Rounded corners on left side (rounded-l-lg)
- Shadow for depth
- Padding: generous spacing (p-6)

**Mobile-First:**
- Full height menu
- Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px height)
- Smooth scrolling if content overflows
- Close on link click

**Technologies:**
- Next.js 14 App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui Sheet component
- Framer Motion
- TypeScript
- Lucide React icons

Make it modern, playful, and visually appealing - something parents would enjoy using while creating books for their children.
